Moving to a new role as manager, director, or executive means leaving behind habits that have served you well in the past. In fact, some of the skills youâ€™ve used to succeed may even turn into liabilities.
</p>
<p>
Jill Huchital uses her extensive experience as an engineering director at TiVo and Google to provide specialized coaching for engineers who are moving into new roles, and for leaders who are working with engineering teams for the first time. Through her career she has helped many high-performing members of her teams succeed in new challenges, coaching them individually and developing her own unique specialized coaching regime.
</p>
<p>
Jill now works with leaders at various Silicon Valley startups, specializing in helping technical staff move into new roles on the engineering management ladder, and in coaching non-technical founders in how to work with their engineering organizations.
</p>
<p>
In 25 years in high-tech, Jill held engineering leadership roles at Google, YouTube, TiVo, SGI, and Silicon Valley startups, building teams from scratch as well as running large, distributed engineering and product organizations. She holds several patents for her work on video advertising.
